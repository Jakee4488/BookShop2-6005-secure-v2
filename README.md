### Guidelines for Contributing
- Compare against the `development` branch when creating a pull request to allow time for testing and modification before merging into the stable master branch.
- Ensure that Travis CI builds and verifies all pull requests. If your pull request causes the build to fail, please resolve any issues by adding additional commits.
- Create a JSFiddle to demonstrate your code changes if possible, as this greatly helps with feedback.
- Fully test your changes and anticipate edge-case behavior.
- Keep your codebase up-to-date with the origin to avoid falling behind.
