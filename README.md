## Contributing
First of all, thanks for your interest in helping make this project even better. Contributions help resolve rare bugs, accomplish neat new features, polish the code, and improve the documentation.

### Guidelines for contributing
- Compare against the `development` branch when creating a pull request. This allows time to test and modify code changes before merging them into the stable master branch with the next release.
- Travis CI is configured to build and verify all PRs. If your PR causes the build to fail, please add an additional commit that resolves any problems.
- If you want to earn some brownie points, create a JSFiddle that demonstrates your code changes. Seriously, this helps immensely and allows one or multiple people to easily provide feedback on the great work you've done.
- Do your best to fully test your changes. Anticipate edge-case behavior.
- Try to keep your codebase that you're making changes to as up-to-date as possible with the origin. The project creates new releases frequently, so it's easy to fall behind if you've been working on something new for a while.
